## Technologies

Programming Languages

- Go is my go-to to for being productive quickly
- TypeScript because I have to. It's actually not bad
- Python when I forget how much I love type safety
- Rust when I feel like making art

Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions is the best CI/CD tool available
- Docker / Kubernetes for work
- Pulumi / Terraform because infra-as-code is the way
- Netlfy for hobby-sized projects

## Quotes

> I am indeed thrown arbitrarily into history. I therefore choose to voluntarily shoulder the responsibility of my advantages and the burden of my disadvantages -- like every other individual. I am morally bound to pay for my advantages with my responsibility. I am morally bound to accept my disadvantages as the price I pay for being. I will therefore strive not to descend into bitterness and then seek vengeance because I have less to my credit and a greater burden to stumble forward with than others.
